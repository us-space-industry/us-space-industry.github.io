# US Space Industry (Github Pages)
This website was a school project for the english class. Since I am interested in space and the assignment was rather open, I decided to build a site with Nuxt showing different topics in the US Space Industry. It focusses mainly on NASA's budget and funding programs for US American companies providing launch services and proposals to, e.g., lunar landers. 

You can find the website here: [us-space-industry.sthomas.ch](us-space-industry.sthomas.ch). 
Feel free to look around and explore the fantastic world of space companies based in the US :)

New Shepard consists of a Propulsion Module and a separable capsule (officially named Crew Capsule, although it houses crew and / or payloads depending on the mission). It is a launch vehicle that can carry up to six astronauts and / or payload stacks on a suborbital trajectory to 100km and back down again. The capsule seperates from the rocket and experiences microgravity and a free fall for about three minutes until it reenters earth's atmosphere and eventually opens up its parachutes to softly land in the desert. In the last moment, the retro rockets fire in order to enable a softer touchdown. 99% of the first stage' dry mass is reusable by landing the booster back on earth on Blue Origin's landing pad. Therefore, the BE-3 rocket engine burning LH (liquid hydrogen) and LOx (liquid oxygen), fires back up again and brings the speed of the rocket down until the landing.",longText:[],missions:"TODO",diameter:{meters:3.6},firstFlight:"On April 29, 2015, New Shepard lifted the ground for the first time, and achieved an altitude of 93.5km, before the capsule was recovered via parachute landing.

Therefore, the companies' short-term plans are often unclear. In terms of long-term goals, which their latest hiring process Blue Origin is pushing toward, is engineering tools for resource extraction and building commercial space stations to build a commercial human presence in space.","In 2018, a competitive contract award was conducted between Blue Origin, SpaceX as well as ULA and NGIS, specifically asking for launches of national security spacecraft as part of the National Security Space Launch (NSSL), successor program to the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), which is a USSF-program to assure secure access to space for US Department of Defense and other US governmental payloads. Blue Origin was awarded $500M as funding for development of the New Glenn rocket in phase 2; which had as goal to finish development of detailed designs. In phase two, which started on August 12, 2019, two of the four companies were to be selected as launch vendors; Blue Origin lost this against SpaceX and the ULA. From the $500M, Blue Origin already got more than $180M, with the remaining part expected to be paid out until 2024, when the contract expires.",'Blue Origin designed their "Blue Moon" lunar lander to compete about NASA\'s Human Landing System (HLS) contract. The competition started in April of 2019, and Blue Origin announced in 2019 that they would not completely build the lander on their own but rather form the "national team", with Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. For development of detailed ideas, the three potential contractors, SpaceX, Dynetics and Blue Origin were awarded $1B in total, with Blue Origin getting the vast majority at $579M in the first phase of the multi-year competition. In April of 2021, NASA was forced to pick one of those three candidates for the next phase contract; where SpaceX won its $2.9B contract, with the application of Blue Origin for a much larger contract of being denied. Blue Origin, however, filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) stating NASA "flawed competitive acquisition in contravention of BAA rules and requirements.
